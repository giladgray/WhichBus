# WhichBus

The goal of WhichBus is to merge the functionality and convenience of OneBusAway and GoogleMaps into one location so that a user can not only find the route they need to take to get somewhere but also when that bus is coming in realtime. 

###The Problem

People are using Google Maps to plot their route and see which buses (busai?) they need to take in order to get somewhere but then having to switch to OneBusAway in order to see when exactly their bus is going to arrive, early, late, or right on time. 

##The Solution

WhichBus is going to combine these two websites and hopefully add lots of extra value to Seattlites trying to get where they need to go.
